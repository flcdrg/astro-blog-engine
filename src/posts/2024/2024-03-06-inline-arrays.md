### Inline arrays

Super-niche, but I guess if you need it, you'll appreciate it. Previously you'd probably need to resort to using `unsafe` code to deal with this.

```csharp
[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InlineArray(10)]
public struct InlineArray
{
    public int Thing;
}
```

The compiler now knows this is an array of 10 contiguous elements.
