### `ref readonly` modifier

A bit more of a niche feature - if you have code that is passing structs by `ref`, but you don't need to (or want to) allow modification of the parameter, you can now indicate it is readonly.

```csharp
    public static void ByRefReadonly(ref readonly Point p)
    {
        //p = new Point(2, 3);
        Console.WriteLine(p);

    }
```

In the code sample above, `Point` is a struct or record type. If you uncommented the line then the compiler will emit an error.

Interesting, but I've not come across a need to use this yet.
