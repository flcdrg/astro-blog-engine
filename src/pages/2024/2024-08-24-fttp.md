It's all happening here on the Internet front. Last week [I switched ISPs]({% post_url 2024/2024-08-19-leaptel %}), and today we've upgraded from copper to fibre (or 'fiber' for North Americans!). I had a few concerns about how it was going to go, but TL;DR it went really well.

First off, the existing conduit that runs to the house is pretty narrow, so I was worried that it wouldn't be suitable for pulling the fibre, in which case they'd likely need to install a new conduit - digging up the front garden and maybe either cutting through our concrete path or lifting up lots of pavers. Messy and disruptive options.

Secondly, when NBN fibre is installed, they install two boxes. One on the outside of the house (the 'NBN utility box'), and the second inside (the 'NBN connection box' which terminates the fibre and gives you an Ethernet port to plug into). Ideally I really wanted the latter to be located right up the back of our house in a storeroom where all my other networking gear lives. However it's a fair distance internally so I wasn't sure if they would agree to go that far.

Step one was locating the small communications pit that was hiding in our front garden under quite a few layers of leaves and tree bark. I didn't even know this existed until the initial NBN survey of our street almost two years ago uncovered it. It's roughly under the big stick in the photo ðŸ˜€.

The NBN technicians tested the existing conduit that runs from this pit up to the house for blockages by squirting some water from the hose down it. I gather this was successful, so they were happy that the conduit was usable.

The external box was mounted on the outside wall just above where the old conduit came out of the ground. The old copper wire was kept in place. In my case the copper goes into the wall cavity via a brick air vent and up to the fascia underneath the roof gutter where there's a little box that then connects to the internal telephony wiring (in my case I had a [central splitter]({% post_url 2006/2006-10-04-central-splitter-installed %}) just inside the roof and then CAT5 cabling running back up to the aforementioned storeroom).

Rather than pulling the fibre up through the wall cavity following the copper line (I suspect it's probably too risky getting a kink in the fibre), they added extra conduit runs up to the roof and it enters the roof space.

Crawling around inside our roof is not fun, but they managed to get the fibre all the way over to the storeroom and used an existing hole in the ceiling (from when I'd previously run network cables to two wireless access). If I'd been thinking ahead when that room was built, I would have put in a proper large conduit from the wall up to the ceiling so that all those cables could use that!

They installed the 'NBN connection box' on the wall of the storeroom right next to my modem/gateway, network switches and Synology, exactly where I'd hoped it could go.

There was a short outage while they were doing the install - I gather they disconnected the copper for a bit when they were using it to pull the fibre. But it was reconnected and I was back online after a few minutes.

While they were finishing up, I received a text from Leaptel confirming that the new fibre connection was ready.

I've been using a Technicolor MediaAccess TG789vac v2 modem/gateway since we switched from ADSL to FTTN. It was supplied by Internode, but it isn't locked, and it has a WAN port so I was confident it would work as a gateway once our fibre was live.

I pulled out the telephone cable from the back of the gateway and confirmed that there was just a LAN patch cable from the 'NBN connection box' plugged into the gateway WAN port.

Opening the gateway configuration, I navigated to the 'Internet Access' page and clicked on **show advanced**.

I then enabled **Auto WAN sensing** and clicked **Save**, then **Close**.

After a few seconds, the status updated to show the gateway using the WAN connection

And finally, a quick speed test, and wow, isn't that awesome - 106.74Mbs download and 18.1Mbps upload!

Down the track, upgrading the gateway to something like a [Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Gateway Ultra](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/cloud-gateways-compact/products/ucg-ultra) could be nice.
