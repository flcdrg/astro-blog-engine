Another year has passed, and today I clock up 4 years at [SixPivot](https://www.sixpivot.com.au)!

Looking back at [last year's post](/2024/2024-02-01-three-years-sixpivot ), I must say it has been a consistent story.

I'm still enjoying working from home (and my heart goes out to those unfortunate to work for organisations with short-sighted management who are forcing a return to office for no good reasons other than a) they feel lonely in office themselves, b) they're looking at how much they're paying for empty offices or c) they don't trust their employees and figure if they can't see them in the office then how do they know that they're actually working? (To be clear, I think there are some valid reasons to work in an office, but these are not three of them).

I'm still enjoying the flexibility of a morning walk/bike ride/water the garden/pick blackberries/etc before I kick of the work day.

I even more value my SixPivot colleagues. The breadth of experience and opinions is so good. It was great to see them all at our SixPivot Summit last year, and I will again come this July. Plus we have our 'PPP' professional development day coming up in late March where we'll gather in two locations (Brisbane and Melbourne) for a day of technical training and knowledge sharing. (Think a mini '[DDD Conference](https://dddadelaide.com/)' but just for Pivots!)

And it's always nice to get ['good vibes' points]((https://handbook.sixpivot.com.au/perks-and-benefits/benefits#perks)) for my 'workversary'! 4 years means 400 points are mine to spend in the [SixPivot rewards shop](https://handbook.sixpivot.com.au/perks-and-benefits/rewards-shop). Do I buy some gift cards, put them towards my next laptop, phone, a donation to charity or open source, a new SixPivot polo shirt, or maybe all of the above?

I'll be wrapping up my involvement with my current client at the end of February, so I'm looking forward to some new and challenging client engagements soon.
