# David's blog engine using Astro

Based on the astro-blog-tutorial and then customised to fit to how I wanted it to work.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ posts/
| 
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Development

- Uses `pnpm` for package management and itself is managed by `corepack`. To upgrade pnpm, use `corepack up`
